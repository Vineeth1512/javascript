    <h1>
        JavaScript History
    </h1>
    <p>

        JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications. It was initially
        called Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript to capitalize on Java’s popularity.
        <br>
        Timeline of JavaScript History


        1. 1995 – Birth of JavaScript
        Brendan Eich developed JavaScript in just 10 days for Netscape Navigator
        <br> 2.
        It was a lightweight scripting language designed for web interactivity.
        2. 1996 – Microsoft Introduces JScript
        Microsoft created JScript (a reverse-engineered version of JavaScript) for Internet Explorer 3.
        This led to incompatibility issues between browsers. <br>
        3. 1997 – ECMAScript Standardization
        JavaScript was standardized by ECMA International as ECMAScript (ES).
        The first edition, ECMAScript 1 (ES1), was released. <br>

        4. 1999 – ECMAScript 3 (ES3) – Widespread Adoption
        Introduced features like regular expressions, try/catch error handling, and better string handling.
        JavaScript became widely used for web development. <br>
        5. 2005 – Ajax Revolution & Web 2.0
        Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) enabled dynamic, fast-loading web pages.
        Websites like Google Maps, Gmail, and Facebook started using JavaScript heavily. <br>
        6. 2009 – ECMAScript 5 (ES5) & Node.js
        ES5 introduced JSON support, strict mode, and array methods like map, filter, and reduce.
        Ryan Dahl released Node.js, allowing JavaScript to run on servers. <br>
        7. 2015 – ECMAScript 6 (ES6) – Modern JavaScript
        Introduced let & const, arrow functions, classes, modules, promises, and template literals.
        Marked a major shift towards modern JavaScript development.
        <br>
        8. 2016–Present – Continuous Evolution
        ES7 (2016) – includes() method, exponentiation operator.
        <br>
        ES8 (2017) – async/await, Object.values() & Object.entries().
        <br>
        ES9 (2018) – Rest/Spread properties, Promise.prototype.finally(). <br>
        ES10 (2019) – flat(), flatMap(), Object.fromEntries(). <br>
        ES11 (2020) – Optional Chaining (?.), Nullish Coalescing (??). <br>
        ES12 (2021) – String.replaceAll(), Promise.any(). <br>

        Current State of JavaScript
        Most widely used programming language for web development.
        Powers modern frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, and backend with Node.js.
        Continuously evolving with annual ECMAScript updates.

    <h1>What is JavaScript</h1>

    <p>
        JavaScript is a high-level, multi-paradigm programming language primarily used for website development alongside
        HTML and CSS. While HTML and CSS provide the structure and style of a website, JavaScript enables the addition
        of interactive features and behaviors. This allows visitors to engage with the website in more exciting ways.
        Also note that the language is not limited to a specific type of operating system and supports event-driven,
        functional, and imperative programming styles such as object-oriented and prototype-based.
    </p>

    <h1>
        Uses Of JavaScript
    </h1>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Web applications, servers and backend web infrastructure;
        </li>
        <li> Browser-based games;</li>
        <li>Animation and other special effects;</li>
        <li>Security features (such as passwords);</li>
        <li>Automatically refreshing news feeds;</li>
        <li>
            Mobile applications.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>
        JScript and ECMAScript
    </h1>

    <p>At the time of JavaScript’s introduction by Netscape, there was intense competition among browser vendors in the
        market. Other vendors were creating their own versions of JavaScript using different names and syntax. In 1996,
        soon after the launch of Netscape Navigator 3, Microsoft released a new version of its web browser called
        Internet Explorer 3, which had an implementation of its version of JavaScript called JScript. Because JavaScript
        was open and freely licensed, Microsoft was able to reverse-engineer its implementation. Thus, there were two
        versions of JavaScript with no standardization in place. This became a bother for developers, as the code that
        worked perfectly in one browser was useless in another. </p>


    <p>To avoid further conflicts, in 1997, Netscape turned to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA)
        and asked them to standardize JavaScript. By opening up JavaScript to a wider audience, the decision to
        standardize the language through the ECMA committee allowed other potential implementers to have a say in its
        evolution while maintaining accountability. The ECMA committee created a standard known as ECMA-262, which
        defined a new scripting language called ECMAScript. This general-purpose scripting language was adopted by all
        browsers as the basis for their own implementations of JavaScript, ensuring adherence to a common standard.</p>


    <h1>JavaScript vs. Java</h1>
    <p>Despite the similarity in their names, JavaScript and Java are two different programming languages.

    </p>

    <p>Java is an object-oriented, class-based programming language that was developed by Sun Microsystems in the
        mid-1990s. It is compiled into bytecode that can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
        installed. Java is often used for building large-scale enterprise applications, Android mobile apps, and
        server-side web applications.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is primarily used for
        client-side web development and can be inserted into HTML pages. JavaScript code is written in text and can be
        organized, saved, edited, and operated as text files. It supports event-driven, functional, and object-oriented
        programming paradigms. The language is also widely used for creating interactive web pages, web applications,
        and mobile applications.</p>


    <p>JavaScript was created to be interpreted at runtime, making it more dynamic. Programs made from Java can run on
        either a virtual machine or a browser. JavaScript programs are mostly run in a browser. Another significant
        difference is that both languages require different libraries and plug-ins to function. </p>


    <h1>What makes JavaScript unique</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>It can be fully integrated with HTML and CSS;</li>
        <li>It is supported by all major browsers;</li>
        <li>There are numerous frameworks written in Javascript (like React, Angular, Vue, React Native, etc.);</li>
        <li>JavaScript allows creating actions like button clicks, form submissions, and animations;</li>

    </ul>
